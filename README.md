  ## üìå Project Overview
A machine learning project to predicts **whether a loan application will be approved or not** based on applicant details such as age, income, employment, credit history, and loan details.  
It uses **Logistic Regression**, a statistical model, to make predictions.

## üìù Description
Financial institutions like banks and loan companies face the challenge of deciding **who should be given a loan**. Poor lending decisions can lead to defaults.  
This project provides a **data-driven approach** to help lenders make informed decisions.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
Loan default is one of the biggest challenges faced by financial institutions. Traditional manual methods of assessing applications are time-consuming and may overlook important patterns in customer data. This leads to high rejection rates, approval of risky applicants, and loss of potential revenue. To address this, a data-driven approach is required to analyze customer attributes and build a predictive system that can improve decision-making, reduce risks, and ensure fair loan approvals.

## üéØ Project Objective
To develop a **predictive model** that accurately determines **loan approval** based on applicant attributes.


## üìÇ Data Source
The dataset was obtained from kaggle website | [LINK](#https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/loan-approval-classification-data)

## üìä Dataset Description
The dataset used is a loan application dataset containing **45,000 records** and **14 features**.  

- **Target variable:** loan_status (0 = Not Approved, 1 = Approved)

- **Independent variables:** applicant‚Äôs demographics, loan details, and credit history.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| person_age | Age of applicant |
| person_gender | Gender of applicant |
| person_education | Education level |
| person_income | Annual income |
| person_emp_exp | Employment experience (years) |
| person_home_ownership | Home ownership status |
| loan_amnt | Loan amount requested |
| loan_intent | Loan purpose (Education, Medical, etc.) |
| loan_int_rate | Loan interest rate (%) |
| loan_percent_income | Loan-to-income ratio |
| cb_person_cred_hist_length | Credit history length (years) |
| credit_score | Credit score of applicant |
| previous_loan_defaults_on_file | Past default record (Yes/No) |
| loan_status | Target variable (0 = Not Approved, 1 = Approved) |


## üõ† Tools
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- **Scikit-learn** (Logistic Regression, preprocessing, evaluation)

- **Statsmodels** (VIF for multicollinearity checks)

## üîç Methodology
1. Data Cleaning ‚Äì Handle missing values, duplicates, inconsistent data.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ‚Äì Understand data patterns using statistics and visualizations.

3. Multicollinearity Check ‚Äì Ensure predictors are not too closely related.

4. Model Building ‚Äì Train a Logistic Regression model.

5. Model Evaluation ‚Äì Check accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC.

## üßπ Data cleaning 
- No missing values found.

- No duplicate records.

- Encoded categorical variables (gender, education, loan intent, etc.) into numbers.

## üìà Summary Statistics Interpretation
- **Average age = 28 years** ‚Üí mostly young applicants.  
- **Average income = 80,000**.  
- **Loan amounts ranged from 500 ‚Äì 35,000.**  
- **Credit scores mostly between 600 ‚Äì 850.**  
- About **22% of applicants were approved** (`loan_status = 1`), while **78% were rejected** (`loan_status = 0`).

## üìä Visual insights 
![Screenshot](Screenshot_20250830-182947.jpg)

**Loan Status Distribution**  
  - Majority of applicants (78%) had their loans **not approved**.  
  - Only about 22% were **approved**, showing that lenders are more conservative in approvals.
    
![Screenshot](Screenshot_20250830-183043.jpg)

**Loan Intent**  
  - Most loan applications were for **medical, education, and personal use**.  
  - This shows that many applicants borrow for essential needs (health, school) and personal expenses.  

![Screenshot](Screenshot_20250830-183059.jpg)

**Education Level**  
  - Majority of applicants had **Bachelor‚Äôs education**.  
  - Applicants with **Master‚Äôs and Doctorate degrees** were fewer but still significant.

**Home Ownership**  
- Most applicants were **renters**, followed by those with a **mortgage**.  
- Few applicants fully owned their homes, showing higher dependency on borrowed housing.

## üìâ Multicollinearity Check (VIF)

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was calculated to detect multicollinearity among predictors:

| Feature                        | VIF       | Interpretation |
|--------------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| const                          | 379.91    | ‚ùå Very high (ignored, constant term) |
| person_age                     | 14.12     | ‚ùå High multicollinearity |
| person_gender                  | 1.00      | ‚úÖ No multicollinearity |
| person_education               | 1.00      | ‚úÖ No multicollinearity |
| person_income                  | 1.44      | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| person_emp_exp                 | 11.27     | ‚ùå High multicollinearity |
| person_home_ownership          | 1.16      | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| loan_amnt                      | 2.20      | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| loan_intent                    | 1.00      | ‚úÖ No multicollinearity |
| loan_int_rate                  | 1.08      | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| loan_percent_income            | 2.21      | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| cb_person_cred_hist_length     | 3.93      | ‚úÖ Moderate, acceptable |
| credit_score                   | 1.07      | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| previous_loan_defaults_on_file | 1.13      | ‚úÖ Acceptable |

### üîé Interpretation
- **Threshold:** A VIF > 10 indicates **high multicollinearity**.  
- `person_age (14.12)` and `person_emp_exp (11.27)` show **serious multicollinearity** ‚ùå.  
- Most other predictors have **VIF < 5**, meaning they are acceptable ‚úÖ.  

## üõ† Handling Multicollinearity

From the VIF analysis:

- `person_age` (VIF = 14.12) and `person_emp_exp` (VIF = 11.27) showed **high multicollinearity** ‚ùå.  
- Logistic regression significance testing showed `person_emp_exp` was **not statistically significant** (high p-value).  
- To improve model stability, we **dropped `person_emp_exp`** from the dataset.  

### ‚úÖ Updated VIF After Dropping `person_emp_exp`

| Feature                        | VIF   | Interpretation |
|--------------------------------|-------|----------------|
| const                          | 226.95 | ‚ùå Very high (ignored, constant term) |
| person_age                     | 4.05   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| person_gender                  | 1.00   | ‚úÖ No multicollinearity |
| person_education               | 1.00   | ‚úÖ No multicollinearity |
| person_income                  | 1.44   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| person_home_ownership          | 1.16   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| loan_amnt                      | 2.19   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| loan_intent                    | 1.00   | ‚úÖ No multicollinearity |
| loan_int_rate                  | 1.08   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| loan_percent_income            | 2.21   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| cb_person_cred_hist_length     | 3.93   | ‚úÖ Moderate, acceptable |
| credit_score                   | 1.07   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| previous_loan_defaults_on_file | 1.13   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |

### üîé Interpretation
- After dropping `person_emp_exp`, **all remaining variables have VIF < 5**, which is within the safe range.  
- This reduces redundancy and ensures that predictors provide **unique information** to the logistic regression model.

| loan_int_rate                  | 0.9887      | 2.6878     | ‚úÖ Higher interest rates strongly increase approval likelihood (banks approve but charge more risk premium). |
| loan_percent_income            | 1.2783      | 3.5905     | ‚úÖ Applicants with smaller loan-to-income ratios are **3.6√ó more likely** to be approved. |
| cb_person_cred_hist_length     | -0.0388     | 0.9619     | ‚ùå Longer credit history slightly reduces approval odds (not a big effect). |
| credit_score                   | -0.4581     | 0.6325     | ‚ùå Lower credit scores reduce approval likelihood. |
| previous_loan_defaults_on_file | -4.4903     | 0.0112     | üö® Past loan defaults **drastically reduce** approval chances. |

### üîé Key Insights
- **Strong Positive Predictors**: Loan-to-Income Ratio, Loan Interest Rate, Home Ownership, Income.  
- **Strong Negative Predictors**: Loan Amount, Credit Score, Previous Defaults.  
- **Minimal/No Impact**: Gender, Education.
