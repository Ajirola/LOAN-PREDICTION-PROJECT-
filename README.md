  ## üìå Project Overview
A machine learning project to predicts **whether a loan application will be approved or not** based on applicant details such as age, income, employment, credit history, and loan details.  
It uses **Logistic Regression**, a statistical model, to make predictions.

## üìù Description
Financial institutions like banks and loan companies face the challenge of deciding **who should be given a loan**. Poor lending decisions can lead to defaults.  
This project provides a **data-driven approach** to help lenders make informed decisions.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
Loan default is one of the biggest challenges faced by financial institutions. Traditional manual methods of assessing applications are time-consuming and may overlook important patterns in customer data. This leads to high rejection rates, approval of risky applicants, and loss of potential revenue. To address this, a data-driven approach is required to analyze customer attributes and build a predictive system that can improve decision-making, reduce risks, and ensure fair loan approvals.

## üéØ Project Objective
To develop a **predictive model** that accurately determines **loan approval** based on applicant attributes.


## üìÇ Data Source
The dataset was obtained from kaggle website, here's the link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/loan-approval-classification-data

## üìä Dataset Description
The dataset used is a loan application dataset containing **45,000 records** and **14 features**.  

- **Target variable:** loan_status (0 = Not Approved, 1 = Approved)

- **Independent variables:** applicant‚Äôs demographics, loan details, and credit history.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| person_age | Age of applicant |
| person_gender | Gender of applicant |
| person_education | Education level |
| person_income | Annual income |
| person_emp_exp | Employment experience (years) |
| person_home_ownership | Home ownership status |
| loan_amnt | Loan amount requested |
| loan_intent | Loan purpose (Education, Medical, etc.) |
| loan_int_rate | Loan interest rate (%) |
| loan_percent_income | Loan-to-income ratio |
| cb_person_cred_hist_length | Credit history length (years) |
| credit_score | Credit score of applicant |
| previous_loan_defaults_on_file | Past default record (Yes/No) |
| loan_status | Target variable (0 = Not Approved, 1 = Approved) |


## üõ† Tools
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- **Scikit-learn** (Logistic Regression, preprocessing, evaluation)

- **Statsmodels** (VIF for multicollinearity checks)

## üîç Methodology
1. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, duplicates, inconsistent data.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Understand data patterns using statistics and visualizations.

3. Multicollinearity Check: Ensure predictors are not too closely related.

4. Model Building: Train a Logistic Regression model.

5. Model Evaluation: Check accuracy, precision, recall, ROC-AUC.

## üßπ Data cleaning 
- No missing values found.

- No duplicate records.

- Encoded categorical variables (gender, education, loan intent, etc.) into numbers.

## üìà Summary Statistics Interpretation
- **Average age = 28 years** ‚Üí mostly young applicants.  
- **Average income = 80,000**.  
- **Loan amounts ranged from 500 ‚Äì 35,000.**  
- **Credit scores mostly between 600 ‚Äì 850.**  
- About **22% of applicants were approved** (`loan_status = 1`), while **78% were rejected** (`loan_status = 0`).

## üìä Visual insights 
![Screenshot](Screenshot_20250830-182947.jpg)

**Loan Status Distribution**  
  - Majority of applicants (78%) had their loans **not approved**.  
  - Only about 22% were **approved**, showing that lenders are more conservative in approvals.
    
![Screenshot](Screenshot_20250830-183043.jpg)

**Loan Intent**  
  - Most loan applications were for **medical, education, and personal use**.  
  - This shows that many applicants borrow for essential needs (health, school) and personal expenses.  

![Screenshot](Screenshot_20250830-183059.jpg)

**Education Level**  
  - Majority of applicants had **Bachelor‚Äôs education**.  
  - Applicants with **Master‚Äôs and Doctorate degrees** were fewer but still significant.

**Home Ownership**  
- Most applicants were **renters**, followed by those with a **mortgage**.  
- Few applicants fully owned their homes, showing higher dependency on borrowed housing.

## üìâ Multicollinearity Check (VIF)

Variance Inflation Factor (VIF) was calculated to detect multicollinearity among predictors:

| Feature                        | VIF       | Interpretation |
|--------------------------------|-----------|----------------|
| const                          | 379.91    | ‚ùå Very high (ignored, constant term) |
| person_age                     | 14.12     | ‚ùå High multicollinearity |
| person_gender                  | 1.00      | ‚úÖ No multicollinearity |
| person_education               | 1.00      | ‚úÖ No multicollinearity |
| person_income                  | 1.44      | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| person_emp_exp                 | 11.27     | ‚ùå High multicollinearity |
| person_home_ownership          | 1.16      | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| loan_amnt                      | 2.20      | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| loan_intent                    | 1.00      | ‚úÖ No multicollinearity |
| loan_int_rate                  | 1.08      | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| loan_percent_income            | 2.21      | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| cb_person_cred_hist_length     | 3.93      | ‚úÖ Moderate, acceptable |
| credit_score                   | 1.07      | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| previous_loan_defaults_on_file | 1.13      | ‚úÖ Acceptable |

### üîé Interpretation
- **Threshold:** A VIF > 10 indicates **high multicollinearity**.  
- `person_age (14.12)` and `person_emp_exp (11.27)` show **serious multicollinearity** ‚ùå.  
- Most other predictors have **VIF < 5**, meaning they are acceptable ‚úÖ.  

## üõ† Handling Multicollinearity

From the VIF analysis:

- `person_age` (VIF = 14.12) and `person_emp_exp` (VIF = 11.27) showed **high multicollinearity** ‚ùå.  
- Logistic regression significance testing showed `person_emp_exp` was **not statistically significant** (high p-value).  
- To improve model stability, we **dropped `person_emp_exp`** from the dataset.  

### ‚úÖ Updated VIF After Dropping `person_emp_exp`

| Feature                        | VIF   | Interpretation |
|--------------------------------|-------|----------------|
| const                          | 226.95 | ‚ùå Very high (ignored, constant term) |
| person_age                     | 4.05   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| person_gender                  | 1.00   | ‚úÖ No multicollinearity |
| person_education               | 1.00   | ‚úÖ No multicollinearity |
| person_income                  | 1.44   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| person_home_ownership          | 1.16   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| loan_amnt                      | 2.19   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| loan_intent                    | 1.00   | ‚úÖ No multicollinearity |
| loan_int_rate                  | 1.08   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| loan_percent_income            | 2.21   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| cb_person_cred_hist_length     | 3.93   | ‚úÖ Moderate, acceptable |
| credit_score                   | 1.07   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |
| previous_loan_defaults_on_file | 1.13   | ‚úÖ Acceptable |

### üîé Interpretation
- After dropping `person_emp_exp`, **all remaining variables have VIF < 5**, which is within the safe range.  
- This reduces redundancy and ensures that predictors provide **unique information** to the logistic regression model.

## ‚úÖ Model Evaluation

### üìä Accuracy
- Overall Accuracy: **0.89 (89%)**


### üìë Classification Report

| Class (Loan Status) | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Support |
|----------------------|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| 0 (Not Approved)    | 0.92      | 0.93   | 0.93     | 10,493  |
| 1 (Approved)        | 0.76      | 0.74   | 0.75     | 3,007   |
| **Overall / Avg**   | **0.89**  | **0.89** | **0.89** | 13,500  |


### üî≤ Confusion Matrix

|                  | Predicted: 0 | Predicted: 1 |
|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Actual: 0**    | 9803         | 690          |
| **Actual: 1**    | 795          | 2212         |

- **True Negatives (9803):** Correctly predicted loan rejections.  
- **True Positives (2212):** Correctly predicted loan approvals.  
- **False Positives (690):** Predicted approved, but actually rejected.  
- **False Negatives (795):** Predicted rejected, but actually approved.  

### üìà ROC-AUC Score
- **ROC-AUC = 0.95** ‚Üí The model has excellent discrimination ability between approved and not approved loans.


### üîé Interpretation
- The model performs **very well overall (89% accuracy)**.  
- It is **more accurate at predicting rejections (Class 0)** than approvals (Class 1).  
- Precision and Recall for loan approvals are slightly lower (0.76 and 0.74), meaning some approved loans are still being misclassified.  
- The high ROC-AUC (0.95) confirms strong performance in distinguishing between approved and rejected cases.


## üîÑ Cross-Validation Results

To ensure the model‚Äôs performance was not due to overfitting, **5-fold cross-validation** was applied.  

### üìä Fold Accuracies
- Fold 1: **0.8842**  
- Fold 2: **0.8946**  
- Fold 3: **0.8790**  
- Fold 4: **0.8937**  
- Fold 5: **0.8993**  

### üìå Mean CV Accuracy
- **0.8902 (‚âà 89%)**

### üîé Interpretation
- The cross-validation accuracies are **very consistent** (all around 88‚Äì90%).  
- The small variation across folds shows the model is **stable and generalizes well**.  
- Confirms that the Logistic Regression model is **reliable and not overfitted**.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Recommendation
- The model shows strong performance (Accuracy = 89%, ROC-AUC = 0.95) and can be reliably used as a **first-level loan screening tool**.  
- Lenders can use it to **automatically flag high-risk applicants**, saving time and reducing financial risk.  
- Strong predictors such as **credit score, loan-to-income ratio, and past defaults** should be given higher weight in decision-making.  
- Applicants with borderline cases (e.g., average credit score but no past defaults) should undergo **manual review** instead of outright rejection.
