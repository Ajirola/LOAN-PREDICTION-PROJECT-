  ## 📌 Project Overview
A machine learning project to predicts **whether a loan application will be approved or not** based on applicant details such as age, income, employment, credit history, and loan details.  
It uses **Logistic Regression**, a statistical model, to make predictions.

## 📝 Description
Financial institutions like banks and loan companies face the challenge of deciding **who should be given a loan**. Poor lending decisions can lead to defaults.  
This project provides a **data-driven approach** to help lenders make informed decisions.

## ❓ Problem Statement
Loan default is one of the biggest challenges faced by financial institutions. Traditional manual methods of assessing applications are time-consuming and may overlook important patterns in customer data. This leads to high rejection rates, approval of risky applicants, and loss of potential revenue. To address this, a data-driven approach is required to analyze customer attributes and build a predictive system that can improve decision-making, reduce risks, and ensure fair loan approvals.

## 🎯 Project Objective
To develop a predictive model that accurately determines loan approval based on applicant attributes.


## 📂 Data Source
The dataset was obtained from kaggle website | [LINK](#https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/taweilo/loan-approval-classification-data)

## 📊 Dataset Description
The dataset used is a loan application dataset containing **45,000 records** and **14 features**.  

- **Target variable:** loan_status (0 = Not Approved, 1 = Approved)

- **Independent variables:** applicant’s demographics, loan details, and credit history.

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| person_age | Age of applicant |
| person_gender | Gender of applicant |
| person_education | Education level |
| person_income | Annual income |
| person_emp_exp | Employment experience (years) |
| person_home_ownership | Home ownership status |
| loan_amnt | Loan amount requested |
| loan_intent | Loan purpose (Education, Medical, etc.) |
| loan_int_rate | Loan interest rate (%) |
| loan_percent_income | Loan-to-income ratio |
| cb_person_cred_hist_length | Credit history length (years) |
| credit_score | Credit score of applicant |
| previous_loan_defaults_on_file | Past default record (Yes/No) |
| loan_status | Target variable (0 = Not Approved, 1 = Approved) |


## 🛠 Tools
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

- **Scikit-learn** (Logistic Regression, preprocessing, evaluation)

- **Statsmodels** (VIF for multicollinearity checks)

## 🔍 Methodology
1. Data Cleaning
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Multicollinearity check (VIF)  
4. Logistic Regression model building  
5. Model Evaluation → Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC-AUC, Cross-Validation

## 🧹 Data cleaning 
- Checked for missing values (none found).

- Checked for duplicates (none found).

- Encoded categorical variables using LabelEncoder.
